# Sphere
Sphere Exercise. Getting Area, Volume etc of a sphere


Original equation on this challenge was wrong.

The correct equation is:

V = 4/3 πr³

I thought I would add a few extra opnes other than just Volume.

### Area & Surface Area

The main difference between area and surface area is that area is used to describe the space occupied by a two-dimensional shape, whereas, surface area is the area occupied by the outer surface of a three-dimensional shape. 

What is Area?
Area is a term associated with two-dimensional figures and shapes like triangles, squares, and rectangles, and it is measured in square units. It can be imagined as the total space or region occupied by a two-dimensional shape on a flat surface. Different figures have different areas. For example, a square has 4 equal sides and the area of a square is the total number of square units occupied by the square and is calculated with the help of the formula: side × side. The area of a triangle is calculated using the formula: 1/2 × base × height. Similarly, different shapes have different formulas to calculate the area.

What is Surface Area?
Surface area is a term that is associated with three-dimensional figures and shapes. In other words, surface area applies to a polyhedron, where a solid shape has flat faces. A cube is a shape that has all its faces in the shape of a square. Therefore, we can say that the surface area of a cube is the sum of the area covered by all the faces of a cube and it is calculated by the formula: Surface area of a cube = 6a2. The formula used to calculate the total surface area of a cuboid = 2(lw+wh+lh), where 'l' is the length, 'w' is the width, and 'h' is the height of the cuboid. In a three-dimensional shape like a cone, the surface area is given by the sum of the curved surface area and the area of its base, which is a circle. The curved surface area is the area of the curved part in a solid shape, whereas, the lateral surface is the difference between the total surface area and the area of the base and top of the shape. It is to be noted that the curved surface area applies only to shapes that have curved surfaces. Observe the following figure which shows the areas and surface areas of 2D and 3D shapes.
